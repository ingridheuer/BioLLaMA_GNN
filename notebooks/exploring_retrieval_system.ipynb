    "A key aspect of RAG systems is an Information Retrieval component. This is the part of the overall system that deals with finding the correct document (or in this case, nodes and clusters) to answer the user's query. If we dont implement a good IR module, the system will not be able to find the corresponding data and will likely hallucinate its answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I'm experimenting with a few \"classic\" NLP techniques to index documents and extract meaning from them. This approach allows me to run this part of the system locally with very few resources and without using additional HF calls, which makes it very resource-effective. I'm generally following the guidelines provided by [anthropic's recent blogpost](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval)."

       "'A type of acute or chronic skin reaction in which sensitivity is manifested by reactivity to materials or substances coming in contact with the skin. It may involve allergic or non-allergic mechanisms. An inflammatory process in skin caused by an exogenous agent that directly or indirectly injure the skin. If the offending agent is identified and removed, the eruption will resolve. An unusual or patterned eruption may be a clue to the presence of a contact dermatitis. Patch testing may be helpful in the differential diagnosis.  An inflammatory skin condition caused by direct contact between the skin and either an irritating substance or an allergen. type of acute or chronic skin reaction in which sensitivity is manifested by reactivity to materials or substances coming in contact with the skin; may involve allergic or non-allergic mechanisms. A recurrent contact dermatitis caused by substances found in the work place. Contact dermatitis associated with allergens or irritants found in the workplace. A polymorphic pattern of inflammatory reaction of the skin in response to contact with external irritants or allergens. A non-allergic contact dermatitis caused by prolonged exposure to irritants and not explained by delayed hypersensitivity mechanisms. An inflammatory skin condition caused by direct contact between the skin and an irritating substance. It is typically manifested by erythema, mild edema, and scaling at the affected site. An inflammatory skin condition caused by an immune response to direct contact between the skin and an allergen. It consists of a delayed type of allergic reaction at the affected site with resulting red, swollen, and blistered skin that may itch or leak. A contact dermatitis due to allergic sensitization to various substances. These substances subsequently produce inflammatory reactions in the skin of those who have acquired hypersensitivity to them as a result of prior exposure. A type of acute or chronic skin reaction in which sensitivity is manifested by reactivity to materials or substances coming in contact with the skin.

A recurrent contact dermatitis caused by substances found in the work place. Contact dermatitis associated with allergens or irritants found in the workplace. A hypersensitivity condition of skin or mucous membranes at the site of direct surface contact with irritants or allergens. A general class that includes both immunologic and non-immunologic conditions. A polymorphic pattern of inflammatory reaction of the skin in response to contact with external irritants or allergens. Contact hypersensitivity is an inflammatory response induced by antigen-reactive T cells that are exposed to antigen on the skin surface Poison ivy is a frequent cause of such reactivity, due to the urushiol from the plant, as are a variety of antigens derived from industrial exposure These antigens induce the appearance of Th1-like T cells, which presumably produce ifn to activate macrophages. A type of eczema characterized by pruritic coin-shaped patches on the skin. Nummular eczema most commonly occurs on the extremities, particularly the legs, but may occur anywhere on the trunk, hands, or feet  A delayed hypersensitivity involving the reaction between sunlight or other radiant energy source and a chemical substance to which the individual has been previously exposed and sensitized. It manifests as a papulovesicular, eczematous, or exudative dermatitis occurring chiefly on the light-exposed areas of the skin. A red, edematous rash that occurs on areas of the skin with recent exposure to sunlight. The cardinal symptom is severely pruritic skin lesions. Macular, papular, papulovesicular, urticarial, multiforme- and plaque-like variants are differentiated morphologically, hence the name polymorphous. Usually one morphology dominates in a single individual The skin lesions develop a few hours to several days after sun exposure. Initially, patchy erythema develops, accompanied by pruritus. Distinct lesions then develop. The upper chest, upper arms, backs of the hands, thighs, and the sides of the face are the primary localizations. The skin lesions resolve spontaneously within several days of ceasing sun exposure and do not leave behind any traces.  Increased skin reactivity to light exposure. increased sensitivity of the skin to light and other sources of uv A disorder characterized by an increase in sensitivity of the skin to light. Dermatitis caused by exposure to sunlight An abnormal inflammatory skin condition resulting from exposure to ultraviolet light, most commonly sunlight. May result from phototoxic or photoallergic reactions or both. Abnormal responses to sunlight or artificial light due to extreme reactivity of light-absorbing molecules in tissues. It refers almost exclusively to skin photosensitivity, including sunburn, reactions due to repeated prolonged exposure in the absence of photosensitizing factors, and reactions requiring photosensitizing factors such as photosensitizing agents and certain diseases. With restricted reference to skin tissue, it does not include photosensitivity of the eye to light, as in photophobia or photosensitive epilepsy. Increased sensitivity of the skin to light exposure. An increased sensitivity of the skin to light. Photosensitivity may result in a rash upon exposure to the sun Photosensitivity can be diagnosed by phototests in which light is shone on small areas of skin.  A nonimmunologic, chemically induced type of photosensitivity producing a sometimes vesiculating dermatitis. It results in hyperpigmentation and desquamation of the light-exposed areas of the skin. A condition in which the skin or eyes become very sensitive to sunlight or other forms of light. It can be caused by taking certain drugs, or rubbing certain essential oils or other topical agents into the skin. Phototoxicity causes sunburn, blisters, and other skin problems. A nonimmunologic, chemically induced type of photosensitivity. Dermatitis caused or precipitated by exposure to ultraviolet sunlight, or by mediating phototoxic or photoallergic material in response to ultraviolet sunlight.'"

      "Early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (EOAD) is a progressive dementia with reduction of cognitive functions. EOAD presents the same phenotype as sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) but has an early age of onset, usually before 60 years old. An acute and potentially fatal metabolic condition characterized by cerebral edema, fatty liver, and hypoglycemia. It occurs primarily in children, and has been associated with the use of aspirin for the treatment of viral infections. However, it can also occur in the absence of aspirin use. A disabling degenerative disease of the nervous system occurring in middle-aged or older persons and characterized by dementia and failure of memory for recent events, followed by total incapacitation and death. Types of the Alzheimer syndrome are differentiated by the age of onset and genetic characteristics. The early onset form and the late onset form Three forms are identified: ad-1, ad-2, ad-3. Some of the clinical characteristics of the Alzheimer syndrome are similar to those of the Pick syndrome. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia among older people. Dementia is a brain disorder that seriously affects a person's ability to carry out daily activities. AD begins slowly. It first involves the parts of the brain that control thought, memory and language. People with ad may have trouble remembering things that happened recently or names of people they know. A related problem, mild cognitive impairment , causes more memory problems than normal for people of the same age. Many, but not all, people with mci will develop AD. In ad, over time, symptoms get worse. People may not recognize family members. They may have trouble speaking, reading or writing. They may forget how to brush their teeth or comb their hair. Later on, they may become anxious or aggressive, or wander away from home. Eventually, they need total care. This can cause great stress for family members who must care for them. AD usually begins after age 60. The risk goes up as you get older. Your risk is also higher if a family member has had the disease. No treatment can stop the disease. However, some drugs may help keep symptoms from getting worse for a limited time. NIH: National Institute on Aging A rare form of dementia that is sometimes familial. Clinical features include aphasia; apraxia; confusion; anomia; memory loss; and personality deterioration. This pattern is consistent with the pathologic findings of circumscribed atrophy of the poles of the frontal lobe and temporal lobe. Neuronal loss is maximal in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala. Some ballooned cortical neurons contain argentophylic bodies. :339-54; Adams et al., Principles of Neurology, 6th ed, pp1057-9) A rare disease that damages the brain and liver and causes death if not treated. It occurs most often in children younger than 15 years who have had a fever-causing virus, such as chickenpox or flu. Taking aspirin during a viral illness may increase the risk of Reye syndrome. Reye syndrome is a rare illness that can affect the blood, liver, and brain of someone who has recently had a viral infection. It always follows another illness. Although it mostly affects children and teens, anyone can get it. It can develop quickly and without warning. It is most common during flu season. Symptoms include Nausea and vomiting Listlessness Personality change - such as irritability, combativeness or confusion Delirium Convulsions Loss of consciousness If these symptoms occur soon after a viral illness, seek medical attention immediately. Reye syndrome can lead to a coma and brain death, so quick diagnosis and treatment are critical. Treatment focuses on preventing brain damage. There is no cure. The cause of Reye syndrome is unknown. Studies have shown that taking aspirin increases the risk of getting it. Because of that, health care professionals now recommend other pain relievers for young patients. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke rare, acute, sometimes fatal disease of childhood, most often occurring as a sequel of varicella or a viral upper respiratory infection of childhood; marked by recurrent vomiting and elevated serum transaminase levels with distinctive changes in the liver and other viscera; an encephalopathic phase with acute brain swelling disturbances of consciousness and seizures may follow. A degenerative disease of the brain characterized by the insidious onset of dementia. Impairment of memory, judgment, attention span, and problem solving skills are followed by severe apraxias and a global loss of cognitive abilities. The condition primarily occurs after age 60, and is marked pathologically by severe cortical atrophy and the triad of senile plaques; neurofibrillary tangles; and neuropil threads.  The presence of dementia in an individual younger than age sixty five. A rare neurodegenerative disorder leading to dementia. It is characterized by frontotemporal lobar degeneration with accumulation of tau proteins which form Pick bodies. A degenerative disease of the brain characterized by the insidious onset of dementia. Impairment of memory, judgment, attention span, and problem solving skills are followed by severe apraxia and a global loss of cognitive abilities. The condition primarily occurs after age 60, and is marked pathologically by severe cortical atrophy and the triad of senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuropil threads.  Loss of intellectual abilities in an elderly person, interfering with this person's activities. neurodegenerative disorder of the cns resulting in progressive loss of memory and intellectual functions; begins in the middle or later years; characterized by brain lesions such as neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques. result of genetic metabolic defects or damage by exogenous or endogenous toxins; characterized by cerebral cortex atrophy and progressive cerebral demyelination; dementia and mental deterioration are common. An acute and potentially fatal metabolic disorder characterized by cerebral edema, fatty liver and hypoglycemia. It occurs primarily in children and has been associated with the use of aspirin for the treatment of viral infections. However, it can also occur in the absence of aspirin use. A brain disorder that usually starts in late middle age or old age and gets worse over time. Symptoms include loss of memory, confusion, difficulty thinking, and changes in language, behavior, and personality. A progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of function and death of nerve cells in several areas of the brain leading to loss of cognitive function such as memory and language. loss of intellectual functions such as memory, learning, reasoning, problem solving, and abstract thinking while vegetative functions remain intact. A form of encephalopathy with fatty infiltration of the liver, characterized by brain edema and vomiting that may rapidly progress to seizures; coma; and death. It is caused by a generalized loss of mitochondrial function leading to disturbances in fatty acid and carnitine metabolism. Any Alzheimer disease in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the ADAM10 gene.

A degenerative disease of the brain characterized by the insidious onset of dementia. Impairment of memory, judgment, attention span, and problem solving skills are followed by severe apraxias and a global loss of cognitive abilities. The condition primarily occurs after age 60, and is marked pathologically by severe cortical atrophy and the triad of senile plaques; neurofibrillary tangles; and neuropil threads.  A degenerative disease of the brain characterized by the insidious onset of dementia. Impairment of memory, judgment, attention span, and problem solving skills are followed by severe apraxia and a global loss of cognitive abilities. The condition primarily occurs after age 60, and is marked pathologically by severe cortical atrophy and the triad of senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuropil threads.  A brain disorder that usually starts in late middle age or old age and gets worse over time. Symptoms include loss of memory, confusion, difficulty thinking, and changes in language, behavior, and personality. A progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of function and death of nerve cells in several areas of the brain leading to loss of cognitive function such as memory and language. A disabling degenerative disease of the nervous system occurring in middle-aged or older persons and characterized by dementia and failure of memory for recent events, followed by total incapacitation and death. Types of the Alzheimer syndrome are differentiated by the age of onset and genetic characteristics. The early onset form and the late onset form Three forms are identified: ad-1, ad-2, ad-3. Some of the clinical characteristics of the Alzheimer syndrome are similar to those of the Pick syndrome. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia among older people. Dementia is a brain disorder that seriously affects a person's ability to carry out daily activities. AD begins slowly. It first involves the parts of the brain that control thought, memory and language. People with ad may have trouble remembering things that happened recently or names of people they know. A related problem, mild cognitive impairment , causes more memory problems than normal for people of the same age. Many, but not all, people with mci will develop AD. In ad, over time, symptoms get worse. People may not recognize family members. They may have trouble speaking, reading or writing. They may forget how to brush their teeth or comb their hair. Later on, they may become anxious or aggressive, or wander away from home. Eventually, they need total care. This can cause great stress for family members who must care for them. AD usually begins after age 60. The risk goes up as you get older. Your risk is also higher if a family member has had the disease. No treatment can stop the disease.

Who is at risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder ? Obsessive-compulsive disorder usually begins when you are a teen or young adult. Boys often develop ocd at a younger age than girls. Risk factors for ocd include Family history. People with a first-degree relative who has ocd are at higher risk. This is especially true if the relative developed ocd as a child or teen. Brain structure and functioning. Imaging studies have shown that people with ocd have differences in certain parts of the brain. Researchers need to do more studies to understand the connection between the brain differences and OCD. Childhood trauma, such as child abuse. Some studies have found a link between trauma in childhood and ocd. More research is needed to understand this relationship better. In some cases, children may develop ocd or ocd symptoms following a streptococcal infection. This is called Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections What are the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder ? People with ocd may have symptoms of obsessions, compulsions, or both: Obsessions are repeated thoughts, urges, or mental images that cause anxiety.

Some common compulsions include Excessive cleaning and/or handwashing Repeatedly checking on things, such as whether the door is locked or the oven is off Compulsive counting Ordering and arranging things in a particular, precise way Some people with ocd also have a Tourette syndrome or another tic disorder. Tics are sudden twitches, movements, or sounds that people do repeatedly. People who have tics cannot stop their body from doing these things. How is obsessive-compulsive disorder diagnosed? The first step is to talk with your health care provider about your symptoms. Your provider should do an exam and ask you about your health history. He or she needs to make sure that a physical problem is not causing your symptoms. If it seems to be a mental problem, your provider may refer you to a mental health specialist for further evaluation or treatment. Obsessive-compulsive disorder can sometimes be hard to diagnose. Its symptoms are like those of other mental disorders, such as anxiety disorders. It is also possible to have both ocd and another mental disorder. Not everyone who has obsessions or compulsions has ocd. Your symptoms would usually be considered ocd when you Can't control your thoughts or behaviors, even when you know that they are excessive Spend at least 1 hour a day on these thoughts or behaviors Don't get pleasure when performing the behaviors. But doing them may briefly give you relief from the anxiety that your thoughts cause. Have significant problems in your daily life because of these thoughts or behaviors What are the treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder ? The main treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder are cognitive behavioral therapy, medicines, or both: Cognitive behavioral therapy is a type of psychotherapy. It teaches you different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to the obsessions and compulsions. One specific type of cbt that can treat ocd is called Exposure and Response Prevention ex/rp involves gradually exposing you to your fears or obsessions. You learn healthy ways to deal with the anxiety they cause. Medicines for ocd include certain types of antidepressants. If those don't work for you, your provider may suggest taking some other type of psychiatric medicine.
